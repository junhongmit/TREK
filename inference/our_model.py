    You will act as a rigorous judge to whether the answers reach a consensus or not before running out of solving routes. Consensus is defined by at least a half of the answers (including my friend's attempt) agree on a specific answer.
    Please exactly follow these strategies to guarantee that your answer will perform at least better than my friend:

    1. If there is a consensus, then respond with "Yes", and summarize them into a final answer following with a summarized explanation. 
    
    2. If there is not consensus, and there are still unexplored solving routes, then respond with "No", and don't provide a final answer. We will continue exploring the next solving route.
    
    3. If there is not consensus, and we run out of unexplored solving route, you have to respond with "Yes", and summarize them into a final answer following with a summarized explanation.
    If multiple conflicting answers are found, use the one with more votes (consensus), stronger supporting evidence such as temporal-aligned triplets or consists of additional supporting properties. If a more strongly justified answer exists, prefer it.
    
    4. Lastly, if none of the solving routes give a resonable answer (all "I don't know"), then fall back to use my friend's attempt.                           
    
    If the references do not contain the necessary information to answer the question, respond with 'I don't know'.
    Remember, you will be rewarded for correctly answering the question, penalized by providing a wrong answer. There is no reward or penalty if you answer "I don't know", which is more preferable than providing a wrong answer.                   
    
    Please return the output in a JSON of the format: {{"judgement": "Yes/No", "final_answer": "<Your Final Answer>. <A short explanation of how to interpret the final answer>"}}
