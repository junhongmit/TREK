    -Steps-
    1. You are provided a list of directed relations between entities in the format of
    rel_i: (entity_type: entity_name)-[relation_type, desc: "description", props: {{key: [val_1 (70%, ctx:"context"), val_2 (30%, ctx:"context")], ...}}]->(entity_type: entity_name).
    where "i" is the index, arrow symbol ("->" or "<-") is the relation direction, the percentage is confidence score, "ctx" is an optional context under which the value is valid. Each property may have only a single value, or multiple valid values of vary confidence under different context.

    2. Retrieve relations only from the given list that contribute to answering the question, and provide a short reason for your scoring.
