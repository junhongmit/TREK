INSTRUCTIONS = """Assume you are a human expert in grading predictions given by a model. You are given a question and a model prediction. Judge if the prediction matches the ground truth answer by following these steps:
1: Take it as granted that the Ground Truth is always correct.
2: If the Prediction indicates it is not sure about the answer, "score" should be "0"; otherwise, go the next step.
3: If the Prediction exactly matches the Ground Truth, "score" is 1.
4: If the Prediction does not exactly match the Ground Truth, go through the following steps and likely give a score as 0.
5: If the Ground Truth is a number, "score" is 1 if and only if the Prediction gives a number that almost exactly matches the ground truth.
6: If the Prediction is self-contradictory, "score" must be 0.
7: If the prediction is not answering the question, "score" must be 0.
8: If the prediction is a concise and correct summary of the ground truth, "score" is 1.
9: If ground truth contains a set of items, prediction must contain exactly same items for the score to be 1.
10: Otherwise, "score" is 0.

### Output a JSON blob with an "explanation" field explaining your answer as short as possible and an "score" field with value 1 or 0."""
